## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project was ver funny to develop. 
I use the new way to declare rules in CSS.
It was very useful to made the code easier to read.
Also, I learned how to handle the submit event without using space in memory.


I am proud of this piece of code. 
It is simple but it looks nice.

```JS1
form.addEventListener('submit', (e)=> {
    rateMsg.innerHTML = `You selected ${current[0].value} out of 5`;
    rateCard.style.display = 'none'
    cardSubmited.style.display = 'flex';
})
}
```
